**[Compatibility]**: *FoundryVTT* 0.6.0+  
**[Systems]**: *any*  
**[Languages]**: *English, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil)*  

This module aims to provides system agnostic solution to handle unidentified items and their identification for games via Foundry Virtual Tabletop.

## Installation

1. Install Forien's Unidentified Items using manifest URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Forien/foundryvtt-forien-unidentified-items/master/module.json
2. While loaded in World, enable **_Forien's Unidentified Items_** module.

## Usage
Right click on items in sidebar, or use buttons on Item Sheet's header to Mystify an item. It will create new apparently blank item.

Mystified item can be fully edited and works just as a normal item in that system. However, GM can at any point peek at what the original item is (currently it's not possible to edit original data).

GM can also click on "Identify" button, which transforms entire Item into original, using embedded data.  
Data used during identification is decided upon at the time of mystification.  


## Future plans (current ideas)

Plans for future include:
* Transmogrification – mystified item should copy all data of some plain item while still having data for original
  * "Mystify as…" option for context menu.
* Editing original data of mystified item
* Some system specific integrations for setting data as weight (dnd5e) or encumberance (wfrp4e) etc.

You can **always** check current and up-to-date [planned and requested features here](https://github.com/Forien/foundryvtt-forien-unidentified-items/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aenhancement)
