**[Compatibility]**: *FoundryVTT* 0.6.0+  
**[Systems]**: *any*  
**[Languages]**: *English, Korean, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil)*  

This module aims to provides system agnostic solution to handle unidentified items and their identification for games via Foundry Virtual Tabletop.

## Installation

1. Install Forien's Unidentified Items using manifest URL: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Forien/foundryvtt-forien-unidentified-items/master/module.json
2. While loaded in World, enable **_Forien's Unidentified Items_** module.

## Usage

**Please refer to Wiki for full information on [Usage](https://github.com/Forien/foundryvtt-forien-unidentified-items/wiki#usage)**  

Right click on items in sidebar, or use buttons on Item Sheet's header to Mystify an item. It will create new apparently blank item.

Mystified item can be fully edited and works just as a normal item in that system. However, GM can at any point peek at what the original item is (currently it's not possible to edit original data).

GM can also click on "Identify" button, which transforms entire Item into original, using embedded data.  
Data used during identification is decided upon at the time of mystification.

## System Integration

|            	| dnd5e 	| pf2e 	| wfrp4e 	|
|------------	|-------	|------	|--------	|
| Settings   	| ✓     	| ✓    	| ✓      	|
| Logic      	| ✗     	| ✗    	| ✗      	|

One of main principles of this module is being [**System Agnostic**](https://github.com/Forien/foundryvtt-forien-unidentified-items/wiki#1-completely-system-agnostic). There is however, way of integrating systems.

Basic settings initialization (like setting default persisting properties for dnd5e) I will allow to be built-in this module. These can, however, be defined from the System's side.

#### What about logic? Skill Checks for Identification?

According to this module's Primary Principle, there will never be any system-specific logic in module. Feel free to integrate logic into your System or your Module, using API and Hooks

### How to integrate?

If you are **System** or **Module** developer, please read the [Developers Wiki](https://github.com/Forien/foundryvtt-forien-unidentified-items/wiki/Developers) for API and Hooks references.

Also, do not hesitate to contact me with questions and for assistance.
