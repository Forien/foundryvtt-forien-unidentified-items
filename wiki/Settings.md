There are multiple settings in Module Configuration you can adjust, but there are two I believe need explaining:

## Allow tiering (nesting)

Checking this option allows to Mystify a Mystified Item, opening possibility for nested/tiered items that can be identified one at a time.

## Default Icons Manager

Allows you to choose **default** icons that mystified items will get, based on their `item type`.

Module comes with 20 predefined icons, but you can upload and choose your own.

## Persisting Properties Manager

Allows you to choose which item properties should be by **default** kept on mystification.

Module comes with predefined settings for:
* WFRP 4e
* D&D 5e
* PF 2e
