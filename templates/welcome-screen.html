        <p>I am currently unemployed and am devoting as much time as I can to building modules and contributing to the Foundry community. Presently, this amounts to many hours a day.</p>
        <p>Without your support, I'm afraid I will have to greatly reduce the amount of time I can devote to my projects and to you, the wonderful people of the Foundry community.</p>
        <p>I recognize that not everyone has the resources to do so (which is fine!), but <strong>if you can safely afford that, please consider <a href="https://www.patreon.com/forien" target="_blank">becoming a Patron</a></strong>. ALL contributions help, regardless of level.  It really would mean the world to me and I can't thank you enough for even considering it. Let's build more awesome functionality into FoundryVTT together!</p>
